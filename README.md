# Codility Lessons Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to codility tasks for the learning lessons, it is not nessecarrly the only way to solve them but what you find here is my most effiecient approach.
Each folder contains the lesson respectively and a sub folder of the tasks within each lesson, you can also find a README.md file on each folder explaining the apprach taken to solve each task.
